WP Image Borders makes it easy to add or remove image borders from pictures in your blog posts.

== Description ==

WP Image Borders makes it easy to:

* Remove image borders
* Add borders around images
* Change image border styles
* Change image border colors
* Change image border width
* and add shadows to images in your posts

Check off the checkbox labeled 'Remove Image Borders?' at the top of the WP Image Borders settings page, to remove the picture border from all pictures in your blog posts.  Any border styles created with the plugin will not show as long as this box is checked.

To add borders around your images, first make sure that checkbox is no longer checked.  Then you can use the 'Customize Image Borders' section to change the style, width, radius, and color of your borders.  You can also use the 'Add Drop Shadows to Images' options section to add box shadows to your images.

In order to remove drop shadows, simply reduce the Horizontal and Vertical Distance to zero.  If you only want drop shadows without any border, just reduce the border with to 0.  Border radius acts independently, so you can use it to round out the corners of your images with or without borders or shadows.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the direction of the drop shadows? =

A positive Horizontal Distance value will put the shadow on the right side of the image, but if you make this value negative, it will move the shadow the same distance to the left instead.  If you create a negative value for the Vertical Distance, it will move the shadow above the image rather than below.

= What is Border Radius? =

Border radius is the level of curvature of the image's border.  A higher border radius will result in rounder corners, while a border radius of zero will result in crisp right angled corners.
